They’re usually clumped together in patches. Cold sores may persist for two weeks or longer. A common virus called herpes simplex causes cold sores. They can spread from person to person through close contact, such as kissing. The sores are contagious even when they’re not visible. There’s no cure for cold sores, and they may return without warning. Certain medications can be used to treat cold sores and prevent them from coming back.",
